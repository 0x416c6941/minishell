BUILTINS 
	For now I'm assuming that builtin args is skipped, when passing args to the
	builtins

pwd 
	use only getcwd command -> no need to have get_env_value (can be outdated or unsetted)
	static buffersize = 4096. Should we make dynamic?

export builtin
	"export" without arg: Should print all envvar with prefix "declare -x "
	"export" with valid key=value: Add/update a new key=value pair to envvar. Will be 
			printed by export and env command. 
	"export" with invalid key=value: Add a new key without value. Will be printed 
			by export command, but will not env command.

	In our implementation will be added only valid key=value pair

exit builtin
	In every cases it should print exit (and really exit) and than print error if
	occurs.
	Set last_exit code:
		0: with no arguments provided
	 	1: too many arguments
		2: numeric argument required (in case of overflow too)
		0-256: if in range of LONG_MIN/LONG_MAX -> modullo 256 and if negative -> +256
	Returns:
		EXIT_SUCCESS: by default
		EXIT_FAILURE: if const char *args[] or int *last_exit_code is NULL.
		
expander for ~ (home working directory)
	UPDATE: this is not required by subject.pdf!

output file should be created before executing the command


executor is started before all heredocs are handled - fix this behaviour
	we need to handle all heredocs, stdin and stdout redirs before executing anything
