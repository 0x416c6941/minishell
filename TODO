-Werror disable in both Makefiles!!!!!!


SEGFAULT if envvar is too bid -> bad dynamic buffer

1. we can add basic input validation before parse to check: 

	if input if only spaces -> do not add to history 
	if || or && ; \ -> do not supported 
	if there is unclosed "" or '' 
	if starts with a pipe: "bash: syntax error near unexpected token `|'"  
	if ends with a pipe: bash wait for the rest of command, but we just throw error  
	Handle *

	handle this weird stuff:
		cat >> >>
			Most likely I'll just add some function like
			ft_check_arg(const char *arg, const enum e_arg_type arg_type)
			and replace ft_check_arg_quotes() on e.g. line 98 in
			ft_get_cmd_raw_quotes.c to properly handle it.

	return values should be further adjusted e.g. in ft_process_stdout_redir_arg,
	see line 100: replace 0 with a function, that would generate
	an errcode.

2. output file should be created before executing the command 

parse/ft_get_cmd_raw_quotes.c: If $ret == NULL and $status != -1,
	adjust $status to show exactly what went wrong:
		if a redirecting file (or heredoc's EOF) was missing,
		if some quote wasn't closed (and if so, what quote exactly), etc.
