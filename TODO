-Werror disable in both Makefiles!!!!!! (?)

Input validation:
	check for "|\0".

expander for ~ (home working directory)
	UPDATE: this is not required by subject.pdf!

probably divide parse sources to input_validation?
	Do I even care?

important thing in input_validation:
	remake ft_are_there_mistakes_in_parsed_cmd() to
		ft_are_there_syntax_errors_in_parsed_cmd().
	If there are, don't run anything else;
	Also generate errmsgs() before ft_are_there_syntax_errors_in_parsed_cmd().

output file should be created before executing the command

We will NOT use any global variables.
They are allowed only for signal processing, but even for that
they're not required.
