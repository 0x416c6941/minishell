-Werror disable in both Makefiles!!!!!!

SEGFAULT if envvar is too bid -> bad dynamic buffer <--- fix this stuff

Input validation:
	if input if only spaces -> do not add to history 
		not only that, but in that case we don't even want to do anything
		with such an input - just skip it

	||, & (and && of course), ;, \, * -> not supported

	Every other possible stuff will be handled and parser.

output file should be created before executing the command

We will NOT use any global variables.
They are allowed only for signal processing, but even for that
they're not required.
