BUILTINS 
	For now I'm assuming that builtin args is skipped, when passing args to the
	builtins

exit builtin
	 with no option should just break while cyclus and exit with the 
	last exit code or 0. Or I jusr don't know how to use it (it can close child process, 
	but i guess only with || or something like that)

expander for ~ (home working directory)
	UPDATE: this is not required by subject.pdf!

Remaining stuff:
	heredoc expander;
	executioner.

output file should be created before executing the command

We will NOT use any global variables.
They are allowed only for signal processing, but even for that
they're not required.
